# Start Here: Size-Level Availability Exercise

This package contains the assignment PDF and the local mock dependencies. **It does not contain your solution.** You build and run your own service alongside the supplied mocks.

| This README | How to start the mocks, send a sample event to your service, and inspect its calls. |

The product and inventory scenario, APIs, contracts, and figures are hypothetical; they do not describe internal Farfetch systems. Extract this folder and run all commands below from the folder containing `compose.yaml`.

## You implement / we provide

| You implement on your service | We provide |
|---|---|
| `POST /_dev/messages` for test input events | A ready-to-use sample event JSON file |
| CSV upload and job-status endpoints | A ready-to-use 10,000-row CSV |
| Shared processing and asynchronous bulk work | Product Context lookup and 50,000-object snapshot APIs |
| Calls that update availability and publish output events | Availability API and output-event HTTP mocks |

The assignment PDF includes the blue **YOUR SOLUTION HERE** diagram, already rendered and available offline. This plain-text version also works in Markdown viewers:

                                  +--> PROVIDED: output-event HTTP sink
```

No real broker is needed. You send the sample input to your app over HTTP; your app sends the transformed output to the provided HTTP sink. The production broker is a design choice to explain, not infrastructure you must run.

> **Security warning:** WireMock's admin endpoints are unauthenticated. The Compose port must bind only to `127.0.0.1`; the admin endpoints must not be exposed to any network.

## 1. Check prerequisites

- JDK 21 (the project targets Java 21).
- Apache Maven 3.9+.
- Docker Desktop or Docker Engine with Docker Compose v2 available as `docker compose`; the Docker service must be running.
- Keep local ports `8080` (WireMock) and `5000` (the application) available.

The application scaffold is in this repository. It listens on port `5000`; its `GET /health` endpoint confirms the app is running. The WireMock base URL defaults to `http://localhost:8080` and can be overridden with `WIREMOCK_BASE_URL`.

On Windows, verify the JDK Maven will use:

```powershell
java -version
mvn -version
```

Both commands should report Java 21. If `java -version` reports an older version, configure `JAVA_HOME` and `PATH` to select an installed JDK 21; install a JDK 21 distribution (for example, Eclipse Temurin 21) only if one is not already installed. In the current development environment, JDK 21 is installed at `C:\Program Files\Eclipse Adoptium\jdk-21.0.12.101-hotspot`, Maven is installed at version 3.9.16, and Docker is not available. Install Docker Desktop and start it to run the provided WireMock mocks.

Run the commands below from this folder's root. No PowerShell scripts, Python, `pip`, cloud account, or credentials are required. The fixture data is already included; `compose.yaml` and `wiremock\mappings\` configure the HTTP mocks.

## 2. Run the application locally

Start the Java service in one PowerShell window:

```powershell
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Check `http://localhost:5000/health`; a running application responds with `{"status":"UP"}`. You can change its port with `SERVER_PORT` and the mock-service URL with `WIREMOCK_BASE_URL`.

## 3. Start the mocks

The package already includes these deterministic files under `wiremock\__files\`: `product-contexts-PT.json`, `bulk-stock.csv`, and `sample-event.json`. Do not delete them; no fixture-generation step is needed.

```powershell
docker compose up -d
```

Compose runs the public WireMock image with the local mappings and included fixtures mounted read-only. Check readiness at `http://localhost:8080/health`.

**WireMock listens on port `8080`. Starting it does not create or start your application.** Implement and run your own service on a different port; the example below uses `5000`.

## 4. Send the sample input to your service

Start the application locally as described in the previous section. This scaffold currently exposes only the health endpoint; the event-processing route is part of the next implementation step.

`wiremock\__files\sample-event.json` is an inbound `SellerInventoryChanged` message. Your `POST /_dev/messages` route accepts it for local testing. This route is not provided by WireMock and does not require a broker. It should invoke the same processing path that a production message consumer would use.

For example, if your service listens on port `5000`, run:

```powershell
curl.exe --request POST "http://localhost:5000/_dev/messages" `
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" `
  --data-binary "@wiremock\__files\sample-event.json"
```

Replace `5000` with your service's port, or use Postman or another HTTP client. The `@` tells curl to read the included JSON file as the request body. This example uses PowerShell command-line syntax, not a supplied script; Postman avoids needing that shell.

This sends the input event to your app. Your app then calls the provided HTTP mocks and POSTs its transformed `SizeAvailabilityUpdated` event to WireMock at `http://localhost:8080/mock-broker/v1/events`. That WireMock route is an output sink only; it is not the inbound message endpoint or a real broker.

## 5. Inspect the calls your service made

Open `http://localhost:8080/__admin/requests` in Chrome to inspect the requests WireMock received, including request bodies. This is WireMock's request journal, not an application dashboard.

For a fresh sample event your service applies, expect a Product Context lookup, an availability write, and an output-event POST. The original `POST /_dev/messages` request goes to your app, so it will not appear in WireMock's journal.

## 6. Reset or stop the mocks

To clear only the request journal while leaving the mappings running, use PowerShell:

```powershell
curl.exe -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/__admin/requests
```

To reset the mock container to its file-backed startup state and clear its journal, restart the WireMock service:

```powershell
docker compose restart wiremock
```

Stop the mocks and remove the container/network when finished:

```powershell
docker compose down
```

`docker compose down` leaves the included fixture files and source configuration in place.

## Reference: mock routes and fixtures

The mock base URL is `http://localhost:8080`. The configured country is `PT`. Your service calls these provided routes; you do not implement them.

| Method | Route | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/health` | WireMock readiness check |
| `GET` | `/v1/products/{productId}/sizes/{sizeId}?countryCode=PT` | Look up one Product Context |
| `GET` | `/v1/product-contexts/snapshot?countryCode=PT` | Return the generated Product Context snapshot |
| `PUT` | `/v1/availability/{sellerId}/{productId}/{sizeId}?countryCode=PT` | Submit an Availability API update |
| `POST` | `/mock-broker/v1/events` | Publish an output event; a normal request returns `202` |
| `GET` | `/fixtures/bulk-stock.csv` | Download the deterministic bulk CSV |

The single-item route and snapshot return the same Product Context model. Product IDs range from `style-1` through `style-10000`; sizes are `size-34`, `size-36`, `size-38`, `size-40`, and `size-42`. The snapshot contains 50,000 Product Context objects and the CSV has 10,000 data rows. Fixture order is deterministic but not sorted. The sample context `(style-123, size-38, PT)` is present; `style-9999` is inactive, and `(style-9998, size-38, PT)` returns with `countryEnabled: false`. Other unknown product/size/country combinations return `404`.

## Reference: deterministic fault inputs

Use these request values to exercise error handling. They are fixed WireMock mappings, not queued faults:

| Mock | Input | Response |
|---|---|---|
| Product Context | `GET /v1/products/style-90001/sizes/size-38?countryCode=PT` | `429` with `Retry-After: 5` |
| Product Context | `GET /v1/products/style-90002/sizes/size-38?countryCode=PT` | `503` |
| Availability API | `PUT /v1/availability/seller-429/style-123/size-38?countryCode=PT` | `429` with `Retry-After: 5` |
| Availability API | `PUT /v1/availability/seller-503/style-123/size-38?countryCode=PT` | `503` |
| Event sink | `POST /mock-broker/v1/events` with an event whose `eventId` is `fault-429` | `429` with `Retry-After: 5` |
| Event sink | `POST /mock-broker/v1/events` with an event whose `eventId` is `fault-503` | `503` |

Availability requests use a JSON body such as `{"availableQuantity":3,"sourceVersion":7}`. The event sink selects its fault response from the submitted event's `eventId`.
